## What this Repository Contains

My notes and educational resources that helped me understand some of the concepts.

## Why this repository

- Most of us search online for topics that we don't understand and suddenly come across a particular resource and have our "aha!" moment. Definitely, I would want to have those resources noted down. 
- No single resource is good enough for me to get complete grasp on a topic and would end up going through chain of topics like a software package dependency list. I would want to note those dependencies.
- Sometimes a learning outcome is because of meticulous efforts in trying to understand a topic. I would want to keep track of my thought process and learning summary.
